\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section


 The following document will outline and describe the mobile application meant to answer the question ``What is this?'' with respect to natural optical phenomena.  In this document, the question of what the application will do will be addressed, however emphasis will be made to avoid addressing how the mobile application will accomplish its tasks. This document will define the purpose and scope of the application, along with any associated definitions, acronyms and abbreviations. In addition, product perspective, product function, user characteristics, constraints, and assumptions and dependencies will be explored with respect to how they apply to the mobile application. Functional requirements and non functional requirements will also be defined in this document.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection

 As mentioned previously, the requirements document is meant to describe everything that the system must do. This will include all tasks that the application must complete as shown in the functional requirements, as well as how the application must look, perform, be maintained, be usable and be secure as shown in the non functional requirements. Through the use of business events and viewpoints, the requirements document will outline how the application must react to different user stimulus. The intended audience of this document is the teaching assistants as well as the proffesor. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
% Begin SubSection

The application will be called Nature Optix.  The product will allow the user to answer a set of questions asked by the application. The application will then try to determine what natural phenomena the user is trying to specify based off the users answers. The application will also allow the user to take pictures of the phenomena and post it to social media. The objective of this application will be to enable the user to identify natural and optic phenomena. Other features, such as allowing the user to post picture to social media will help to generate awareness of different natural and optic phenomena.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
\indent The rest of this document will be organized into 3 parts as follows: Overall Description, Functional Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements. Each of these sections are further broken down. The Overall Description will discuss product perspective, product function, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions and dependencies, and apportioning of requirements. The Functional Requirement will list all functional requirements and provide business events and viewpoint corresponding to each. Non-Functional Requirements will be divided into the following sections: Look and Feel requirements, Usability and Humanity Requirements, Performance Requirements, Operational and Environmental Requirements, Cultural and Political requirements, and Legal Requirements. 

% End SubSection

% End Section

\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

%This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. It does not state specific requirements; it provides a background for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
%\begin{enumerate}[a)]
%	\item Put the product into perspective with other related products, i.e., context
%	\item If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be stated here
%	\item If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software
%	\item A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful
%\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection
The product under production will be similar to Akinator, the Web Genie. Akinator is an internet game that is based off of twenty questions. The game has the user think of a charcter or famous person. Akinator then asks the user a series of questions that can be answered with either Yes, No, Maybe, or Don't Know. Akinator than guess who the user is thinking of based on the answer given.  Unlike Akinator, this application will focus soley on identifying natural phenomenon based on user information.\\
Due to the time constraints of the semester the application will be totally self-contained. 
\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
%\begin{enumerate}[a)]
%	\item Provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \textbf{Example}: An SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item Functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time
%	\item Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among variables
%	\end{itemize} 
%\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection
Some of the funtions that the application will perform are as follows;
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify a natural phenomona based on inputs
\item Allow the user to take a photo to share on social media
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
%need the requirements to complete
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
% Begin SubSection
The intended users are assumed to have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise
	\item User has a grade nine level education
	\item Users are aged at least thirteen years
	\item Users are familiar with using mobile applications
	\item Users have accounts with social media websites 
	  
	%\item Do not state specific requirements, but rather provide the reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified
\end{itemize}
These assumptions are made of the user because these are the characterics of the indented audience of the application. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}

\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
Some of the constraints that have been put on the project are;
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options
	\item Time: The project must be completed within the set time of the sesmester. Also the developers time will be spilt between the project and other course work for external classes. 
	\item Budget: The project has a budget of zero dollars becuase it is a school project. 
	\item Software: The application is restricted to run on the Android operating system. This is a constraint that is laid out by the insturcutor for the project. 
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
% need to see the actual requirements to complete.
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assuming that users have phones that run atleast Android 4.0. This allows for the widest availability coverage. 
	\item Assuming that the user's phone has internet access. This allows for users to connect to the experts as well as any other features that are to be implemented.  
	\item Assuming that the user's phone has a build in camera. This allows for the user to take pictures of the natural phenomenon.  
	%\item 
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection
%	\item Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system
