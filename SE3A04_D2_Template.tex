\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
The following document will outline the user interactions, architecture, and classes of the application, NatureOptix.  The intended audience for this document will be the teaching assistants as well as Dr. Ridha Kedhri. It is the goal of this document to provide insight to the intended audience into the internal mechanisms of NatureOptix. After reading this document, the audience should have a good understanding of the way in which a user can interact with the system, the architecture that the system uses, and the classes that comprise the system. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
The NatureOptix application will allow the user to identify a natural phenomena. The application will ask the user a series of questions and the user will be able to specify an answer for each question from a drop down menu. The application will use a combination of repository and blackboard architecture. It will be comprised of 9 entities; 3 experts ( a physicist, a field expert, and a meteorologist), a location expert, a database corresponding to attributes identified by each one of the experts for every optical natural phenomena, and a controller. Each database will contain information about each phenomena specific to what it's expert knows. Each expert will act as an algorithm that compares characteristics of a phenomena in the database to the user input. The physicist will compare the visual attributes, the field expert will compare the physical attributes, and the meteorologist will compare the weather condition attributes required for each phenomena to occur. Each expert will create a list of phenomena that has characteristics that match the user input. The three lists will then be sent to the controller. The controller will determine what phenomenon is common to all three lists and will present this phenomenon to the user. In some boundary cases, the applications shall provide the users with an aggregated list of closest match results to their query. The experts will not be able to communicate to each other and will only be communicating with the database and controller. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
The user interactions will be shown using a use case diagram, along with descriptions of each interaction.  The architecture for the system will be presented using descriptions along with justifications for decisions.  Furthermore, the classes of the application will be outlined using an analysis class diagram as well as a class responsibility collaboration.

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item User wishes to access the app.  The user shall be able to download the app onto their smart phone in order to access it.  This downloading action will be handled by the operating system.  User shall be able to open the app.  The system developer needs to ensure that application shall be able to handle user input, so that the user can access and interact with the app.
	\item User wishes to take a picture and post it to social media.  User can then access the built-in camera on phone and it's functionality from the app.  User can also save the picture to the app and the phone if they so desire.  User shall be able to post to social media directly from the app.  The system developer shall ensure that application can access the internet via wireless connection from smart phone, the built-in camera on the smart phone, and social media (Instagram).  Application shall be able to save pictures directly to the phone.
	\item User wishes to view and modify pictures from the app.  User shall be able to view saved pictures through the app and the phone.  User shall be able delete pictures from the app and the phone.  System Developer shall ensure that application can display requested pictures to the user.  Application shall be able to delete pictures directly on the phone.
	\item User wishes to identify a natural phenomena. User shall be able to post a picture on social media through the app.  The system developer shall ensure that the app can access the user's location using google maps services. App shall have access to the internet via wireless connection from smart phone. App shall be able to switch "expert" modules in order to identify the natural phenomenon.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of your application. You overall architecture should show the division of the system into subsystems with high cohesion and low coupling.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
	%\item Identify and explain the overall architecture of your system
	\item We are using the Model-View-Controller architecture for our system.
	\item The Model View Controller hierarchy helps distinguish the business logic from the controller logic and is useful in creating modularity within the program. We are looking at this from 2 viewpoints:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Our application is centered around displaying information to the user after they provide us with an initial input; the client will be focused on the view after the initial query which is handled by the model and finally connected by the controller to the view. Hence, an MVC architecture seems useful.
		\item MVC sets up our application to be enhanced further upon as it facilitates modular, high cohesion, low coupling design. We can add new modules without disrupting the existing codebase.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Provide a structural architecture diagram showing the relationship among the subsystems (if appropriate)
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
NatureOptix will be broken down into ten subsystems. These subsystems are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item UserInteractionController
	\item ExpertController 
	\item Experts (4),
	\item Database (4).
\end{enumerate}

 The UserInnteractionController will ensure that the proper actions occur after the user has selected them. This means that this class will faciliate user experience. The UserInterfaceController will inciate the process of identifying the phenomenn. Once the user has selected that they wish to identify a phenomeon, this controller will send information to the IdentifyPhenomenon module. It will also recieve the relevant information from the IdentifyPhenomenon class and pass it along to the user.
 
 The ExpertController will control the experts. It is responsible for passing data to the experts and to pass information to the IdentifyPhenomenon module. The ExpertController is also reponsible for facilating the process of swaping experts. This is done with a back and forth with the SwapExpertClass

Three of the four Experts will be implemented as algorithms. These three experts are the Physicist, the FieldExpert, and the Meterologist. The experts will answer questions that pertain to their field. The Physicist will handle all physical aspects of natural phenomena. This includes colour, shape, and size. The FieldExpert will be the expert responsible for identification based on attributes such as temperature and humidity. Finally the Meterologist will attempt to identify phenomeon based on the current weather at the location. The location expert will be the Google Maps API.

The final subsystems are the Databases. Each expert will be assigned a Database. This ensures that the experts are easily swappable. The Database will store all the researched data about the natural phenomenon. Each expert will access the assigned database when needed. Each database will have it's own schema. This makes having multiple databases necessary.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is OK if the text is small but please ensure that it is readable when printed
		\item If you need to break a diagram onto multiple pages, please adopt a system of doing so and thoroughly explain how it can be reconnected from one page to the next; if you are unsure about this, please ask about it
	\end{itemize}
	\item Please submit the latest version of Deliverable 1 with Deliverable 2
	\begin{itemize}
